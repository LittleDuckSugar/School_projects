## Presentation
Here you will find firmwares and some codes to update your touch-screen.<br>

If you already made your choice you can simply [download here](https://github.com/LittleDuckSugar/MyUI/releases) the UI you want and install it.<br>

You can also choose [the big one](#The-big-one) who allows you to change without downloading or anything to differents build-in UIs.<br>

The big one is usefull to try and test UIs but it coast a bit of performance and it can, sometimes, suffer from lags.
For better performance please install only one UI after you made your choice on the device.<br>
